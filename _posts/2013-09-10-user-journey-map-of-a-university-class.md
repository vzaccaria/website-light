Recently, I've been delving more and more into User Experience design, and I thought that my basic computer science class would be an awesome starting point to learn how to apply UX principles to a practical case.

It would be great if — by rethinking some of the aspects of classic academic teaching with modern UX — one could make a more engaging class both for students and the teacher. Of course, it is very difficult to modify the logistic of a in-person class. However, 
rethinking the web technology supporting the class can be beneficial to improve the user (student) experience. 

In an ideal environment, students could:

* interact more with other students by using on-line games, competitions (e.g., [DuoLingo](http://www.duolingo.com/)).
* train directly in the web browser by leveraging modern technology (e.g., [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)) to do their homework.
* comment teacher material (e.g., [Medium](https://medium.com/))

on the other hand, the teacher could:

* measure improvement by considering the execution time and success rate of homework.
* dynamically reschedule the class in the case a topic results into a much harder (or softer) subject.
* use the same web environment during in-loco exams

Above all, being able to *implement* and *measure*, the teacher could apply [lean techniques](http://runninglean.co/) to validate his own product — the class — and build a succesfull learning experience.

I've realizied a first initial User Journey Map to sketch out how the new web environment (green boxes) could be integrated into the class. You can download the pdf [from this link](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/deposit/UX%20-%20UI%20templates.pdf).
