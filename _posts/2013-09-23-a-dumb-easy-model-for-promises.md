*April 2nd, 2014: the post has been edited to fix some errors that were
present in the original article. Thanks to @steve for having pointed
that out*.

[Promises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) are
significantly taking ground as a programming construct for asynchronous
systems such as web applications. In its simplest form, a *promise*
represents the state of the result of some future computation.

I was introduced recently to this construct when studying
[jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/promise/) and
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). At the beginning, I was not able to
wrap my head around it. While I understood the basic callback mechanism
— allowing to be notified when the computation is finished — I struggled
a lot capturing the efficiency with which promises allow to easily
*compose* asynchronous programs.

Enter Petri nets
----------------

[Petri nets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net) have helped me a
lot while creating an easy mental/visual model of promises (and their
composition patterns).

In this post, I will refer to the
["Promises/A+"](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/)
specification. I assume you have already some basic knowledge of it —
especially of the special cases. Besides, I will not indulge in any
mathematical notation of Petri Nets here. If you are interested, I've
put some suggested reading link at the end of this post.

Basic form of promise
---------------------

A promise is an object that has a `then` method[^1]:

    promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)

`then` is used to specify two callbacks — `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`
— that are mutually executed when the state of the promise is resolved
to either *fulfilled* or *rejected*.

In a Petri net, the promise state is represented by a **token** — black
disk — that is positioned on a **place**. In the following figure, the
token is on the *pending* place:

![](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/deposit/pending1.png)

The token can move to another place when the **transition** events —
black squares — fire. Transitions can fire only when they are enabled,
i.e., only when a predetermined number of tokens (**weight**) is
positioned on their input places. Without any particular specification,
the weight corresponds to the number of input places. The number of
marks emitted into a place, when not explicitly shown, is 1.

When the promise is resolved, the output transition from the pending
place is fired. If the promise is fulfilled, the marker 'moves' to the
fulfilled state:

![](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/deposit/fulfilled1.png)

Similarly, the token moves to the rejected place if the promise has been
rejected. So far so good.

Producing a new promise
-----------------------

As shown above, the `then` method returns a new promise:

    p2 = p1.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)

Let's see, with our new visual model, how the execution of the methods
is synchronized with the promise itself:

![](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/deposit/then1.png)

Once `p1` is fullfilled, the transition event `onFulfilled` is fired —
i.e., the callback `onFulfilled` is invoked. If the callback (being it
`onFulfilled` or `onReject`) returns a value, `p2` will be fulfilled
with that value.

On the other hand, if either callback throws an exception, `p2` is going
to be rejected. So listen, if you want to escalate an error when the
first promise is rejected, **throw an exception in your `onRejected`
callback**!

Creating synchronization points with promises
---------------------------------------------

Here I think that the real power of promises is unleashed. If your
callbacks — `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` — return a promise (let's call
it `R`) you can make sure that `p2` is resolved only when both `p1` and
`R` have been resolved; in fact [according to the
specification](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/#point-52):

> If either onFulfilled or onRejected returns a promise (call it
> returnedPromise), promise2 must assume the state of returnedPromise.

This Petri net allows to understand very well what's going on:

![](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/deposit/returned_promise1.png)

Petri nets allow to model these synchronization points very easily. This
is done by forcing the number of tokens that can enable a place
transition. In fact, the transition of 1 token to the `p2-fullfilled`
place can only be fired when there are two tokens on the input of the
commanding transition.

Cheat sheet
-----------

I am astonished about how Petri nets allow us to think in a very clear
way about how we structure our promise chain. I hope this can be useful
for you as it was for me.

    assume that some computation has started and an object representing
    its future value has been created.
