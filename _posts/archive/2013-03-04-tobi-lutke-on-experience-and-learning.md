Nice quote from [Shopify Founder and CEO](http://www.shopify.com/):

{% blockquote Tobi Lütke, http://tobi.lutke.com/the-apprentice-programmer The Apprentice Programmer%}
Not that degrees matter anymore. They do not. Experience does. That is one of the things my apprenticeship and the dual education system in general taught me: experiencing and learning things quickly is the ultimate life skill. If you can do that, you can conjure up impossible situations for yourself over and over again and succeed.
