Tomorrow I'll be presenting some of the latest developments of our research on multi-core architectures at the [Workshop on Platform 2012 / STHORM embedded many-core acceleration](http://www.date-conference.com/conference/workshop-w4).

It'll be an great moment to see how the old friends in ST are doing.
Stay tuned for the presentation slides.
