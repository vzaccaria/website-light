[Here are the slides I've presented](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/data/20130502_hipeac_paris) at the [Making Computer Engineering a Science workshop](http://www.hipeac.net/thematic-session/making-computer-engineering-science), organized by [Grigori Fursin of Inria and cTuning.org](http://ctuning.org/lab/people/gfursin).

Very interesting talks in the same session such as 'Towards Continuous Evaluation of Software Tools' from [Christoph Reichenbach](http://creichen.net/) (Johann-Wolfgang Goethe Universitat Frankfurt, Germany).
