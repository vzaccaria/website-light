I am an assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano and I have worked
in processor architecture research and development for one of the top
semiconductor companies in the world.

Although my background is rooted in modeling and simulation of digital
systems, I've expanded my interests to **parallel** and **asynchronous
programming**, **domain specific languages** and automatic tools for the
web. I also have a thing for **data visualization**, **infographics**
and **javascript**. If you are inclined to work on these topics feel
free to get in touch for a possible collaboration or a thesis.

Troughout the years, I discovered that I love teaching by making
students passionate about computer engineering. I like matching
conventional methods for teaching with novel technology such as
live-coding and program simulation.
