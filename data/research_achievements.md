Here are a few of my major achievements:

* I've successfully created and tuned performance prediction models to obtain less than 10% error versus ISS simulations, dramatically reducing analysis time.

* I am one of the authors of the the ReSPIR optimization algorithm (10x reduction in time, less than 1% error w.r.t. ideal).

* I've led teams of 3 engineers to prototype research tools for processor customization. Prototypes were delivered on-time and within budget of several european FP7 projects.

* I've worked as research and development engineer for STMicroelectronics, one of the top semiconductor industries in the world

* I've pioneered the field of Power Modeling of VLIW Cores (10% error RTL vs Gate-level).

* I've introduced an effective methodology to minimize the effort of design of experiments for NoC power models (10x reduction in characterization time, 33% error).

* I've developed architectural and instruction-set extensions for industrial VLIW processors successfully validated through real-world prototypes.

* I've developed functional models for new streaming architectures, successfully supporting virtual prototyping of software defined radios.

* I am author of over 40 scientific papers about analysis and customization of computer architectures.

* I am co-author of the book Power Estimation and Optimization Methodologies for VLIW-based Embedded Systems, Springer 2003.
