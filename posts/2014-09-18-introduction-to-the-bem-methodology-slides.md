BEM is unarguably one of the most cited technologies in the frontend community. In this presentation I did for a Swiss Frontender's meetup held in September '14, I tried to summarize the main pain points it tries to address and how to effectively put in practice its recipes. Have fun!

*Edit*: someone on Reddit noted that I've inverted the separator for elements (i.e, `__`) and modifiers (i.e., `--`), with respect to the original spec. The important thing is to be consistent with yourself and your team.
