I just managed to get into the beta of [AOL's Alto](http://www.altomail.com/), a new interface for GMail (and other IMAP based mail services), and it is awesome:

From '[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/18/3518454/aol-launches-alto)':

> Alto automatically creates stacks for daily deal emails (Groupon), retail emails (Best Buy) and social networking site notifications (Facebook) â€” three of the most common culprits of messy inboxes. You can also create stacks of your own, which function like Gmail folders that pipe in messages from certain senders. When you click a stack, you see one of three views: message view, tile view, or page view. Message view looks like Sparrow, but adds a unique pie chart to show where the bulk of the messages in that stack are coming from. Tile view creates a grid of messages, each message symbolized by the image in each message (which works well for browsing Groupon or LivingSocial offers). Page view is designed for flipping through your daily deals emails in full-screen as if they were old Sunday Best Buy ad books, Ramirez says.

Except for the (temporary) lack of customization possibilities (like font size and family), I dont think I'll be going back to Gmail..
